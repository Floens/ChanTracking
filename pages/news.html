<p>As I said when I <a href="/news?all#113" target="_blank">announced</a> our 10th anniversary panel, I couldn't think of a better way to celebrate 10 years of 4chan than to spend it with more than <a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/awa13-roomseated.jpg" target="_blank">1,000 of my closest friends</a>.

<h3><span class="newssub">FULL HOUSE by moot - 9/18/13 @ 9:00PM EDT</span><span class="permalink"> <a href="?all#114" id="114" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p>Moderation has always been a hot-button issue on 4chan. <em>"What's considered 'on-topic'?", "How strictly should the rules be enforced?", et cetera</em> have all been debated for years, but while the questions have remained the same, the 4chan of today is not the 4chan of yesterday.</p>
<p>Last month, 4chan was accessed by 22.5 million unique visitors. For comparison, during that same period five years ago, the site was accessed by 3.2 million unique visitors. Rules 1 and 2 be damned, 4chan has grown dramatically over the years.</p>
<p>Despite a seven-fold increase in visitors, what hasn't changed much is the site itself. Aside from the front page redesign some six and a half years ago (a scandal in its day) and the introduction of the catalog and inline extension, from a user's perspective, the form and function of 4chan has largely remained the same. This has been deliberate. While we've made numerous behind-the-scenes improvements to support the site's growth, we've always sought preserve the core 4chan user experience, which is why almost every new user-facing feature has been made optional.</p>
<p>Another thing that hasn't changed much is the number of boards we host. Today we host about 60 boards, whereas in 2008 we hosted just over 40. Why the disparity? I could (and probably will) write an entire news post about this, but for the most part, we've tried to serve a diverse set of interests with as few boards as possible. This is done in the interest of establishing a critical mass to ensure round-the-clock activity, and to avoid unnecessarily fragmenting the community.</p>
<p>So here we are, trying to cram significantly more people into a marginally expanded site, with what is essentially the same software and roughly the same number of volunteers. It's not surprising that this overcrowding has led to quarrels amongst users and disagreements with the staff. We're simply struggling to accommodate more users than ever, who want to discuss more topics, coupled with strong opinions regarding what does and doesn't belong.</p>
<p>The purpose of 4chan's <a href="/rules" target="_blank">Rules page</a> is to answer that question&mdash;what does and doesn't belong. If you look through the rules (as I'm sure you all have), I think you'll find them to be well-intentioned and straightforward. The majority seek to clarify what constitutes "on-topic" posting, and their purpose is not to stifle discussion, but to facilitate it. They're also written to be clearly understood by both the users and moderators, to ensure both compliance and consistency in their enforcement.</p>
<p>Why is "on-topic" discussion so important anyway? It's important to remember that on 4chan every time a new thread is created, <em>one thread is removed</em>. Put another way, for every 10 "culture" threads that are posted, 10 potentially board-appropriate threads are automatically pruned.</p>
<p>There's that word&mdash;<em>culture</em>. "Board culture" is a relatively new term to 4chan, and a particularly divisive one. On one hand, every board undoubtedly has its own unique culture&mdash;it's why we're proud to call ourselves /v/irgins and /k/ommandos. On the other hand, "culture" is often used to justify posts that have little to do with the topic of a board. Under the guise of "board culture," countless off-topic threads are created every day, pushing on-topic discussion off the board. What is considered acceptable board culture is often a grey area, since the term is usually suited to an individual's personal taste, or that of a vocal minority. As one Anon so aptly put it, <em>"One man's 'culture' is another man's 'shitpost.'"</em></p>
<p>Which brings us to that <em>other</em> word&mdash;<em>shitpost</em>. The term "shitpost" has consumed the zeitgeist of 4chan in recent months, and it's a challenge to spend more than a few minutes browsing without stumbling into threads where accusations of shitposting fly left and right. Shitposting, like board culture, is hard to pin down, but I'd define it as simply "knowingly contributing low quality, off-topic, or ill intentioned posts."</p>
<p>4chan's gift of anonymity offers us something not often found on today's Web&mdash;the opportunity to speak our mind and share ideas and be judged for the content of what we write rather than who we are. For a long time, this resulted in an environment unlike any other, one that fostered and rewarded creativity and experimentation. However these days, many posters use this precious gift as a license to say and do whatever they'd like, often to the detriment of the board. Using 4chan should be enjoyable&mdash;but your enjoyment of the site shouldn't come at the expense of your fellow 4channers.</p>
<p>Our small team of volunteers is tasked with an impossible feat: maintaining order and sifting through a never-ending supply of reports and posts, all whilst doing their best to please millions of people. But we try our best, and to that end we've made a number of changes and improvements these past few months. Below is a recap of some of these changes, as well as changes we'll be making going forward. Let's start with some of the previous changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>We've added multiple features to improve content discovery.</strong> People tend to perceive a board's "quality" based on how quickly they're able to find content relevant to their interests, while avoiding content that isn't. We introduced the catalog (and recently added [Search] to the board indexes) to help users quickly survey a board and navigate to threads that interest them. We also added infinite scroll to board indexes (click [All] in the page switcher) to encourage users browse past the first few pages, and have continued to improve our inline extension and its features (notably the thread watcher and filters). If you haven't already checked out the inline extension, you can do so by clicking [Settings] in the upper or lower-right corner of your screen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Our moderation tools were overhauled.</strong> The report queue and appeals interface were rewritten from scratch, resulting in more efficient processing of reports and appeals. The perception that moderation has increased in the past few months is due to moderators and janitors having access to these superior tools, and not any policy changes. Appeals are now processed within hours as opposed to days or weeks, and many of the ban templates have been reduced to 1-3 day board-specific bans. In addition, our moderator and janitor activity log viewer was rewritten to increase oversight. We also audited and removed a number of old spam filters, IP range bans, and country blocks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Going forward, the following will change:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>sage is now invisible.</strong> sage is <em>not</em> a downvote, and this misconception has persisted for far too long. sage replies will continue to function as they have in the past, but will no longer be displayed in the e-mail field.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I'll be doing livestreamed audio PMQ/Q&amp;A sessions from now on, as opposed to written ones.</strong> The audio format enables me to give longer answers to meatier questions, which had been a criticism of the written format. You can listen to the first one <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8eKUzPnW5s&amp;t=1m44s" target="_blank">here</a>. And be sure to subscribe to our <a href="//www.youtube.com/channel/UCCzaqOjCxPAwyQ0X1gxZ65w" target="_blank">official YouTube channel</a> so you can catch future PMQs and our <a href="/news?all#113" target="_blank">10th Anniversary Panel</a> livestream on September 28th.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>/q/ will be retired and replaced.</strong> The imageboard will be replaced with a suggestion box, where you'll be able to contribute feedback, report moderation concerns, and file bug reports. Answers will be searchable and linkable from the boards. As always, questions/comments/concerns can be sent to me directly at <span class="u">moot@4chan.org</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Post timers are now applied separately to intra- and inter-thread replies.</strong> For worksafe boards, intra-thread post timers have been increased to encourage more thoughtful, less chatroom-y replies, whereas inter-thread timers are presently unchanged. On the not-worksafe boards, most of the timers remain the same. The sage timer has been lowered to match that of a normal reply.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Last but not least, we're making bans more transparent.</strong> The <a href="/bans" target="_blank">public ban log</a> displays a sample of recent bans, which we hope will give users insight into what content is being removed, and why.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With 4chan's 10th anniversary just two weeks away, I'm reminded of a <a href="/news?all#95" target="_blank">similar news post I wrote in 2008</a>. It touches on many of the same issues I've discussed here, and ends with the following note:</p>
<p><em style="color: dimgrey;">"Enough about all that though&mdash;back to the big picture. What I want users to take from this gigantic pile of words is that I'm still here and excited as ever to be working on 4chan. We have a lot in store for the site in the coming months. As I've said in the past, stagnation is not acceptable, and 4chan will continue to make strides forward in development. For a site that's essentially just "pictures and text", 4chan has become so much more, and I'm proud of what we as a community have accomplished in what will soon be five years. Thank you for continuing to be a part of it."</em></p>
<p>I feel the same way today as I did five years ago&mdash;excited for the future, and proud of how far we've come. Thanks as always for continuing to be a part of something great.</p>

Thanks to our old friend, <a href="http://manga.clone-army.org/" target="_blank">Dan Kim</a>.</span>
<p>My, how time flies. It feels like just yesterday that I was sitting at a microphone, surrounded by a thousand of my meme-spouting compatriots.</p>
<p>Despite hosting three extremely succesful panels at Otakon 2005, 2006, and <a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/otakon07-roomseated.jpg" target="_blank">2007</a>, I never expected I'd host another. For one thing, we <a href="/news?all#100" target="_blank">weren't invited back</a> in 2008&mdash;not to mention I haven't attended a con in almost five years.
<p>But a recent dinner with some of 4chan's original moderators had us reminiscing about how much fun it was to throw those old panels, and we figured hell&mdash;what better a way to celebrate 4chan's 10th birthday than with 1,900 of our closest friends? Thus, we're pleased to announce:</p>
<p><span class="center"><strong style="font-size: 15pt; text-decoration: underline;">4chan: The Official 10th Anniversary Panel</strong><br/><br/>
<strong style="font-size: 11pt; padding-top: 15px;"><a href="http://www.awa-con.com/?ref=4chan" target="_blank">Anime Weekend Atlanta 2013</a>, September 28th, 10:00PM ET &ndash; Main Events</strong></span></p>
<p>The panel will be hosted by myself and <a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/greenshirtguy_rip.jpg" target="_blank">shut</a>, and feature a number of familiar faces. If you never had the [mis]fortune of attending one of our Otakon panels, you can find them on <a href="//www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWEf1LModzsDofRE19nMMnGCCT9OrMOC7" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. AWA has generously given us use of Main Events on Saturday night at 10:00PM, and we plan to put it to good use&mdash;quarantining the 4channers in attendance. In all honesty, we have only the vaguest sense of what we'll be doing, but I hope you'll join us for what's likely to be our last rodeo. If previous years are any indication, it should be blast. And at the very least, we can shoot for the Guinness World Record of "most fedoras in one room."</p>
<p>So for those of you who can join us, I hope you will. And for those who can't, I hope you'll join us via stream (more info to follow).</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Since this announcement comes on somewhat short notice, we'd appreciate your help spreading the word. Have a friend attending AWA or in the Atlanta area? Tell them to come! If you plan to attend the con and haven't already registered, be sure to do so as soon as possible since pre-registration ends tonight. You can <a href="https://www.regonline.com/Register/Checkin.aspx?EventID=1114022" target="_blank">register here</a> using coupon code "topkek" for a $2 discount. Also ZUN will be there. How can you <em>not</em> come?</p>
<p><strong>mootnote</strong>: I stumbled into these <a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/4chan_con_buttons.jpg" target="_blank"> old con buttons</a> and downtime pages, triggering quite a trip down memory lane. The original artwork the 4chan community produced back in the day is truly incredible. If you haven't already checked out the <a href="/flash" target="_blank">4chan Flash Archive</a>, I highly suggest you do&mdash;4chan City, Sage Man, and LongCat's Song are personal favorites.</p>

<h3><span class="newssub">UPDATES by moot - 10/25/12 @ 3:30AM EDT</span><span class="permalink"> <a href="?all#112" id="112" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p>Last month we began accepting janitor applications for the first time in more than a year. We were overwhelmed by the response and received almost 10,000 applications in just 24 hours.</p>
<p>Now that we've had time to sort through them, we'll be adding janitors in batches over the coming weeks. High traffic boards and boards that need extra moderator attention are our priority, and we hope to have the rest covered shortly after.</p>
<p>In addition to new janitors, we've made two noteworthy changes to our moderation system. The first change is the introduction of a temporary posting block that is applied when a janitor submits a ban request. When a ban request is submitted by a janitor, the user will be blocked from posting for 15 minutes while a moderator reviews the request. If the request is approved, then a regular ban is added (as is the case now), and if the request is denied, the block is removed immediately. This change is being introduced to address the biggest challenge janitors have faced over the years, which is an inability to stop ban evaders, spammers, et cetera from posting while they wait for a moderator to become active and approve their request.</p>
<p>The second change is that we've made bans re-appealable. Historically, once a ban appeal was submitted and denied, there was no way to re-appeal it. You may now appeal your ban up to 5 times, with a short waiting period between each appeal. This should give users with long and permanent bans whose appeals had previously been denied an opportunity to have their ban lifted.</p>
<p>Aside from that, here are a few more changes from the past month and a half:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>4chan's inline extension gained a number of new features, including image hover previews, inline quoting, keyboard shortcuts, and more. Check it out by clicking [Settings] in the upper right-hand corner of any imageboard page. Have a feature request or bug report? Let us know <a href="https://github.com/4chan/4chan-JS/issues" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The 4chan API now supports indexes as endpoints. You can find updated documentation <a href="https://github.com/4chan/4chan-API" target="_blank">here</a>. Fun fact: We're currently processing 50 million API requests <em>per day</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>A few of our servers have been upgraded, adding faster disks and more memory. The site should be functioning as fast as ever.</p></li>
<li><p>The default post limits on the NSFW boards were increased to match the worksafe boards, at 300 bumps and 150 image replies.</p></li>
<li><p>With the release of iOS 6, you can now start threads and upload images from mobile Safari on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>That's all for now! Expect another update concerning janitors once we've added the first few batches.</p>

<h3><span class="newssub">4CHAN PASS by moot - 09/28/12 @ 5:45AM EDT</span><span class="permalink"> <a href="?all#110" id="110" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p>Last week we introduced <a href="https://www.4chan.org/pass" target="_blank">4chan Pass</a> as a way of supporting the site in exchange for a convenient feature. Since then, I've received a handful of questions and feedback that I'd like to address.</p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: larger; text-decoration: underline;">4chan Pass Q&amp;A</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why not accept traditional donations?</strong><br/>
I covered this in my <a href="/news?all#109" target="_blank">original announcement</a>, but I'll take another stab at it.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of ongoing donations. I don't believe it's a model that can sustain large websites (with notable exceptions such as Wikipedia, which also relies on millions in donated hardware and bandwidth, and contributions that are tax-deductible), and frankly, I just don't like them. It's always been my desire to provide 4chan for free to as many people as possible, for as long as possible&mdash;something that gets harder and harder as the years go by and the site's traffic increases&mdash;and view the introduction of 4chan Passes as a means to maintain that goal. I'm proud that we haven't accepted a penny in donations for more than seven years, and view a paid product or service such as a 4chan Pass as an acceptable alternative that provides users with a way of giving back while receiving something of value in return.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I don't feel safe giving 4chan my credit card information.</strong><br/>
All transactions are processed securely by our payment provider&mdash;your card information <em>never</em> passes through nor is it stored on our servers. Your information is sent directly from your browser to their servers for processing. You can learn more about their security <a href="https://stripe.com/help/security" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Will you accept PayPal or alternative payment methods in the future?</strong><br/>
At this time, it's unlikely we'll offer PayPal, Google Checkout, Bitcoin, or other payment methods. If you'd like to purchase a Pass and it's not possible for you to use a debit or credit card, try purchasing a gift card or check if your bank/payment method of choice allows you to generate a "virtual" credit card number.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Will Passes be offered for terms shorter than one year?</strong><br/>
4chan Passes will only be offered in one year increments for a cost of $20 USD, which works out to $1.67 per month, or less than the average 20oz bottle of soda.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why can a Pass only be used from one location at a time?</strong><br/>
Passes may only be used by one IP address at a time due concerns over abuse. You may use a Pass with multiple devices so long as they access 4chan from the same IP address. You can change the IP associated with your Pass once every 30 minutes (lowered from 6 hours!), and this will happen automatically when posting from a device that has already been authorized and cookied. Unless your IP changes more than once every 30 minutes, you shouldn't notice this at all.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I've been banned in the past/am banned often&mdash;will my Pass be revoked?</strong><br/>
In most cases, no. Passes must be revoked manually, and will only be revoked under <a href="/pass#banned">limited circumstances</a>. Regular bans and auto-bans will not revoke your Pass, however you may not use your Pass while banned.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What about the potential for spam and abuse?</strong><br/>
Passes that are used to spam or post illegal content will be revoked, and the payment will not be refunded. In addition, Pass users are still subject to the standard post timers and spam filters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I can't post because my ISP, IP range, or country is blocked. Can I use a Pass?</strong><br/>
Yes. Using a 4chan Pass will allow you to bypass blanket ISP and country blocks, but not individual IP bans.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Can I purchase a Pass as a gift for someone else?</strong><br/>
Yes. Shortly after introducing 4chan Passes, we added the ability to purchase them as a gift. Simply click "Purchase this Pass as a gift for someone else" on the payment form, enter the gift recipient's e-mail address, and we'll mail them the Pass details and a confirmation to you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Is it possible to donate to 4chan without purchasing a Pass?</strong><br/>
No. Again, Passes were introduced as an alternative to accepting donations. If you'd like to support the site, consider purchasing a Pass.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Is it possible to pay more than $20 for a Pass?</strong><br/>
Nope! But if you're interested in contributing more, feel free to purchase Passes as gifts for friends or strangers, or purchase more than one for yourself.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why is CAPTCHA still necessary?</strong><br/>
4chan requires CAPTCHA because spam continues to be an enormous problem for us. Every day, thousands upon thousands of spam posts are automatically filtered before reaching the image boards, and still hundreds slip through. CAPTCHA is extremely effective at blocking automated spam, and spam that slips through is often submitted manually by spammers, or by people paid to solve CAPTCHAs.</p>
<p>In addition to commercial spam, we've also had problems with user flooding, advertising, viruses, worms, and more. Prior to the implementation of CAPTCHA, <em>entire boards</em> were wiped due to spam on a regular basis&mdash;all 10-15 pages. CAPTCHA may be inconvenient, but without it, there wouldn't be a 4chan.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>If you were on the fence about purchasing a <a href="https://www.4chan.org/pass">Pass</a>, I hope these answers helped some. If you have a question that wasn't answered here, please feel free to e-mail <a href="mailto:4chanpass@4chan.org?subject=4chan%20Pass%20-%20Question">4chanpass@4chan.org</a>. Thanks as always for your support.</p>
<p>Expect a news post next week with an update on janitor applications, and a handful of other moderation and site improvements.</p>
<p><strong>PS</strong>: Only three days to go until 4chan's 9th birthday! <img style="border: 0px; margin-top: -10px; padding-left: 3px;" src="//s.4cdn.org/image/emoticons/toot.gif" alt="toot.gif"/></p>

<p>After publishing my news update <a href="/news?all#106">commemorating 4chan's billionth post</a>, I received an outpouring of support from people unaware I had borne the financial burden of keeping the site afloat over the years. Many asked how they could donate, and were disappointed to learn 4chan does not accept donations. With the re-introduction of banner ads to our not-worksafe boards this weekend (which were removed almost a year ago), I believe now is as good a time as any to address these questions.</p>
<p>Historically, 4chan has sustained itself in two ways&mdash;advertising and donations.</p>
<p>Since its earliest days, 4chan has run banner ads to help recoup its formidable hosting costs. Many of you have seen J-List's ads on our worksafe boards, which have been running for the better part of the past nine years. Despite our long-standing relationship with J-List, their ads alone cannot support the cost of the site.</p>
<p>I have always done my best to hold 4chan's advertising to a high standard. Most advertisers who approach us wish to run ads that are irrelevant, pornographic, or have sound, movement, Flash, pop-ups, et cetera. I personally don't block ads and thus browse the site with every ad I'd ask you to. The upside is that with the exception of the adult ads we ran during the economic crisis of 2008, 4chan's advertising has always been unobtrusive, tasteful, and relevant. The downside is that for the past year the site has failed to break even, and I've been covering the loss out of my own pocket.</p>
<p>Many of you have suggested we turn to donations, as we did several years ago. In 2005 we ran a donation drive to raise money to purchase servers, colocate them, and host the site for one year. Ultimately, we fell short of the $20,000 fundraising target, but I still fulfilled my promise&mdash;I purchased three servers, colocated them, and have now hosted the site for more than <strong>7 years</strong> without asking for or accepting a <em>single penny</em> from the community.</p>
<p>Since then, I've made it clear that I do not intend accept donations again. Why? I don't believe in large websites supporting themselves through ongoing donations (a la Wikipedia), both ideologically and practically. I <em>hate</em> the thought of asking users to donate money and receive nothing of value other than "the site doesn't die." Our previous donation drive was more comparable to a modern day crowd-funding project. I asked the community to contribute $20,000 to accomplish three discrete goals, stated a timeframe, and made good on my promise. An explicit contract existed between myself and the contributors, and there was no question about what was being offered in exchange for contributing towards the goal. Ongoing donations are different because there is no stated, discrete goal. You've supported the site by contributing, but now what? What does that get you&mdash;what do you receive in exchange?</p>
<p>Recently it was suggested on /q/ that we allow users to pay to bypass entering a verification when posting, as an alternative to accepting donations. Many people wrote me on /q/ and via e-mail in support of the idea, and after careful consideration, I've decided to implement it. Paying for a product or service is fundamentally different from a donation, while still accomplishing the same goal, and I view this as an acceptable compromise between the two models described above.</p>
<p>Starting today we'll be offering <a href="https://www.4chan.org/pass">4chan Passes</a> as way of supporting the site. You'll find more details at the linked page, but essentially a Pass will allow you to bypass entering a CAPTCHA when posting on the image boards. You'll still be subject to the post timers and nobody else will know you're using a Pass&mdash;your posts will appear exactly the same. But for the many who wished to donate but were unable, I'm pleased to offer this as an alternative whereby you're able to support the site and receive a convenient feature in return.</p>
<p>In two weeks 4chan will turn 9 years old&mdash;something that is almost unfathomable to me. It has always been my goal to provide the community with the best site possible, for as long as I'm able to. We've had our ups and downs, but between the recent HTML5 refactor, mobile site, overhaul of our moderation system, public API, native extension, and new janitors, I'm as excited as ever to explore what the future holds in store.</p>
<p>If you believe in this mission, I hope you'll consider supporting 4chan by unblocking ads and purchasing a <a href="https://www.4chan.org/pass">4chan Pass</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="newssub">JOINING THE FUTURE, ONE COMMIT AT A TIME by moot - 09/05/12 @ 2:00PM EDT</span><span class="permalink"> <a href="?all#108" id="108" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p>In May we launched a radical refactor of our frontend code, migrating 8 year old spaghetti HTML to code that validates HTML5/CSS3. The change was made to improve the rendering speed of large threads and consistency across browsers, and enable extension developers to more easily develop for the site. Along with the new code, we unveiled a responsive design with a mobile optimized view for phones, and also integrated a number of features from our Chrome extension directly into the site&mdash;specifically quick reply, quote previews, backlinking, and inline image expansion. These features alone make the site much more enjoyable to use, but there are many other great features that weren't included in our first pass.</p>
<p>Today represents another radical change to our codebase, with the release of a full featured inline extension. It's also the first major change to the user-facing portion of the site since <a href="/news?all#95" target="_blank">December 2007</a>, when we overhauled the front page and imageboard themes. Almost every feature from our offical extension and other popular third-party extensions has been implemented natively into the site, and a handful have been enabled by default. Furthermore, the project is being <a href="https://github.com/4chan/4chan-JS" target="_blank">posted publically to GitHub</a> and we're inviting the developer community to give us feedback and help make bug fixes and feature suggestions. The code is also being released under an open source, 3-clause BSD license&mdash;a first for us.</p>
<p>My second announcement is another first&mdash;the release of a read-only JSON API. "4chan" and "API" are certainly two words I never thought I'd find in the same sentence, but alas, here we are. Beginning today, every thread will be rendered in JSON and accessible via http(s)://api.4chan.org/<strong>board</strong>/res/<strong>threadnumber</strong>.json</p>
<p>The decision to release an API was <a href="/news/extensions" target="_blank">partially out of necessity</a>, but also because I'm curious to see how people will use it. The total number of official and third-party extension users numbers in the hundreds of thousands (roughly 1.5% of all visitors), and our native extension will reach all 22 million of 4chan's monthly visitors. This potentially has huge performance implications, and it's much more efficent to fetch JSON objects rather than scrape a full HTML page. The difference in filesize and performance is dramatic, with the a JSON representation of a thread being only 10-50% the size of the original HTML. A very crude documentation of the API can be found <a href="https://github.com/4chan/4chan-API" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Before parting, I want to thank the people who made this possible. First, KING JAFFE JOFFER, who single-handedly took the initiative to refactor our HTML and did so with breakneck speed. He also ported our original Firefox extension to Chrome and has been doing a bunch behind the scenes improvements to our backend. Some will remember my recent announcement requesting "JavaScript wizards" contact me, and desuwa, creator of the popular Yotsuba Catalog, answered the call. desuwa completley blew away any expectations I had for this project, and was delightful to work with. I hope he'll remain a contributor to the project for a long time to come. And last but not least, both Mr VacBob and Kate deserve a huge thanks for helping maintain the site's servers over the years. The number of times they've stayed up until 5:00AM troubleshooting servers with me would require more than two hands, and I owe them a <em>lot</em> of lost slumber time.</p>
<p>Thanks again to our awesome volunteers, and most importantly, you the community for making this all possible. I haven't been this excited in years.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: For those of you already using the official or third-party extensions, you'll need to disable your extension via your brower's Extensions/Add-ons menu, or disable the inline extension features by clicking [Settings] in the upper right-hand corner of the page, and selecting "Disable the extension".</p>

<h3><span class="newssub">BETTER MODERATION by moot - 09/03/12 @ 5:30PM EDT</span><span class="permalink"> <a href="?all#107" id="107" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p>In my <a href="/news?all#106">last news post</a>, I touched on an ongoing issue concerning a lack of consistent moderation.</p>
<p>Over the years 4chan has grown considerably, but the team has not. More than 20 million people will visit 4chan in a given month, and of those visitors, 2 million will submit almost 25 million posts. In contrast, there are less than 50 volunteer moderators and janitors.</p>
<p>Why the large gap? For one, it's hard to recruit from an anonymous community, since it can be difficult to identify the best contributors when you don't know who they are. Second, it's just not feasible to have hundreds or thousands of moderators and janitors due to the amount of time it takes to recruit, train, communicate with, and monitor their activities. To that end, instead of scaling the team over the years, we've focused on making moderation more efficient.</p>
<p>Today I'm pleased to announce a big improvement we've made to our ban system. In the past, bans have been submitted individually by moderators, leading to widely inconsistent ban reasons and punishments. Although we do have guidelines in place, they don't cover every circumstance where a user might be banned, and require slow, tedious entry. Ideally, all of this should be automated&mdash;and now it is. Every global and board specific rule has been imported into a drop-down list in the ban panel, and moderators must now select from a set of pre-populated ban reasons and lengths, all of which are codified in the <a href="/rules" target="_blank">Rules</a>.</p>
<p>By standardizing ban reasons and lengths and making sure they correspond to the posted rules, we hope to make life better for everyone on the site. Moderators can perform their tasks more efficiently, banned users will have more insight into why they were banned, and everyone will benefit from rule-infringing content and offenders being removed from the site more quickly.</p>
<p>In addition to rolling out the revised ban system, we'll soon start accepting janitor applications. For those who are not aware, a janitor is a user who has the ability to view the reports queue, delete posts from their assigned board(s), and submit ban requests to moderators. We limit janitors to one or two boards in an attempt to select people who are knowledgeable and frequent visitors to the boards they're assigned. Ideally these people are some of the best contributors on a particular board and wish to make it a better place through both quality contribution and the ability to remove rule-infringing content. If you haven't read the <a href="/janitorapp" target="_blank">application page</a> yet and are interested in applying, I'd encourage you do so.</p>
<p>We will begin accepting janitor applications on September 9th, and <strong>will only accept them for 24 hours</strong>. The application consists of a few pieces of information about yourself such as which boards you browse and what hours you're available to help out, and three long-form questions. All applications are blind screened by the team&mdash;we don't see your name, e-mail address, or other personal information during review. Because we received over 9,000 applications last time around, the entire process is expected to take weeks, and we ask that users <em>do not contact us to inquire about the status of their application</em>. Those who are selected to advance through the process will be notified by e-mail.</p>
<p>Last month, we re-launched <span class="s">/q/ - 4chan Discussion</span>. It's been great to have a place to interact with the community one-on-one again, and I've thoroughly enjoyed reading through the feedback. We've yet to hold our first Q&amp;A session, but I plan to set aside a few hours on a weekend later this month to hang out, answer questions, and respond to your feedback. The thread will stay stickied for a week, so even if you miss out on participating in the discussion, you'll be able to read through it later.</p>
<p>All in all, I hope these changes will address some of the community's concerns about moderation. It's important to remember that the moderators and janitors are people like you&mdash;people who actively use and care about 4chan. They've contributed an untold number of hours in an attempt to keep the site free of garbage, and do an excellent job given the challenges they face&mdash;reacting swifly and consistently, pleasing a rather vocal and unforgiving audience, and being severely outumbered by the userbase and constant stream of new posts.</p>
<p>Thanks to them for their hard work, and thanks to you for your patience.</p>
<p>As always, I can be reached by e-mail at <span class="u">moot@4chan.org</span> and on Twitter at @<a href="//twitter.com/moot" target="_blank">moot</a> and @<a href="//twitter.com/4chan" target="_blank">4chan</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: To clarify, moderators can still enter a custom reason or modify a ban template (reason, length, scope, etc), but are being encouraged to use the standardized ones when possible. If anything, the templates contain more lenient ban lengths and scopes than have been traditionally used. Again, the purpose of this change is to be more <em>consistent</em>&mdash;not more overbearing.</p>

<h3><span class="newssub">BEYOND ONE BILLION by moot - 08/06/12 @ 1:45PM EDT</span><span class="permalink"> <a href="?all#106" id="106" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p>With the exception of my note <a href="/news/extensions" target="_blank">On Extensions</a>, I haven't published a substantial news post since July 2008. It's certainly been an interesting and eventful four years, and I've written and re-written a number of updates that for one reason or another never saw the light of day (or <em>glow of basement</em>).</p>
<p>Let's begin where we left off.</p>
 
<p>In <strong>August 2008</strong> we moved our servers from Texas to California, which involved me renting an SUV and speeding across the desert with 4chan hurriedly loaded into my trunk. I made the trip with a friend and we managed a respectable 24 hours and 10 minutes from Dallas to Los Angeles. The move upgraded our maximum bandwidth throughput from 100Mbps to 1Gbps (later 10Gbps), and resulted in a noticeably faster site.</p>
<p>As it turns out, fast has a downside. Back in <a href="?all#95">early 2008</a> I quoted our old server administrator saying "4chan consumes all bandwidth," and that once again proved to be the case. The resulting surge in bandwidth consumption more than doubled our operating costs, and with the wonderfully timed financial meltdown of 2008, 4chan came as close as it's ever been to going under. This resulted in the widely circulated $20,000 debt figure reported in a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/16/AR2009021601565.html">Washington Post profile</a> published in February 2009.</p>
<p>I still have the drafts of <a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/unpublishednewsposts.png" target="_blank">news posts</a> I wrote while laying awake in bed at 5:00 in the morning. Whatever I would have published, it wasn't a pretty picture.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em style="color: grey;">In 2008, 4chan was accessed by 30 million unique visitors, and served 2.4 billion pageviews.</em></p>
 
 
<p>Yet somehow we made it into <strong>2009</strong>, and things began to look up. Long plagued by an inability to attract mainstream advertising, I partnered with an individual who took over representing 4chan's ad inventory, and for the first time in years the site began to break even.</p>
<p>April brought an amusing twist to an otherwise uneventful year, with the gaming of the 2009 TIME 100 poll. <a href="http://musicmachinery.com/2009/04/27/moot-wins-time-inc-loses/" target="_blank">This article</a> goes into what happened in greater detail, but I was proud to represent the 4chan community in the magazine and at the gala. It even spawned <a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/trolling-is-a-art.jpg" target="_blank">an meme</a>.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the year I purchased the first of what would eventually replace the site's aging Dell severs, which were procured following our "DONATE OR DIE 2005" donation drive. I also <a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/oopsie.jpg" target="_blank">unplugged</a> the servers from the Internet for fun&mdash;sorry!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em style="color: grey;">In 2009, 4chan was accessed by 60 million unique visitors, and served 4.4 billion pageviews.</em></p>
 
 
<p>Lev Grossman of TIME once compared 4chan to <em>Star Wars'</em> Mos Eisley and mused "<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1821656,00.html" target="_blank">Spammers don't even bother to spam 4chan</a>." If only that held true. <strong>2010</strong> brought wave upon wave of spam in the form of JavaScript worms and affiliate link spammers, and the state of the boards reached a new low. After months of trying to mitigate the spam through various means, we resorted to implementing reCAPTCHA across the image boards, intending it to be a temporary fix. Fortunately, it was successful in blocking most automated attempts to spam the site, and immediately reduced the number of malicious images being uploaded to our servers. In fact it worked so well that we decided to make its addition permanent. While verifications can be a pain in the butt to fill out, the unfortunate truth is that 4chan represents a lucrative opportunity for spammers and malware authors. Without CAPTCHA and other measures in place, the site today would be completely overrun with spam as it was in 2010.</p>
<p>Another big change came in the spring of 2010. In May I decided to take a leave of absence from school and start a new project, Canvas. I began working on Canvas to answer the question "What would forums look like if they were invented today?" The form, function, and aesthetic of the modern message board hasn't changed much since the days of Usenet and dial-up BBSes, and I wanted to take a crack at doing something new and different. What we ultimately launched is a community site with the concept of remix culture at its core, something I came to love after years of poking around 4chan MS Paint threads, and /b/ when it was still a fountain of original content.</p>
<p>Many people have asked why I decided to start Canvas as a separate project instead of modernizing 4chan. The answer is simple: I, like you, enjoy 4chan the way it is. I thought it inappropriate and incompatible to change 4chan solely because I wanted to work on something new, and so Canvas spun off while 4chan remained the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em style="color: grey;">In 2010, 4chan was accessed by 130 million unique visitors, and served 7.5 billion pageviews.</em></p>
 
 
<p>In <strong>January 2011</strong>, I fucked up. Frustrated with /r9k/ and /new/, I removed them from the site. It took <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhjtocipcRU&amp;t=10m54s" target="_blank">this exchange</a> (continued <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R_xl2onS24" target="_blank">here</a>) months later with the founder of Encyclopedia Dramatica for me to realize how wrong I was. Shortly after, I re-added them and apologized to the community.</p>
<p>In October I cosplayed Sigourney Weaver at the Web 2.0 Summit and gave a <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3Zs74IH0mc" target="_blank">short talk on online identity</a> and <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzRYYTTcQpo" target="_blank">video interview</a> explaining some of the history of 4chan. If you're at all curious about my opinion on the modern web and 4chan, those might be a good place to start.</p>
<p>November was a rough month. No stranger to distributed denial of service attacks, we were hit by one of the largest we've seen to date. This prompted the transition to using <a href="//www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">CloudFlare</a>. I've <a href="/news/extensions" target="_blank">already explained</a> a bit about what CloudFlare does and does not do, but to recap, CloudFlare helps 4chan primarily in two ways: it caches and serves our images via a CDN that is distributed around the world, making the site load faster and reducing strain on our servers, and helps defend us against the aforementioned DDoS attacks.</p>
<p>The transition was relatively painless, although we did experience a number of hiccups as we brought the site back online. Many of you encountered "Website Currently Unavailable" errors during this time, and have periodically since then. I want to be clear that almost every time you see these errors, the problem is on our end&mdash;not theirs. Since 4chan is run on a shoestring budget and with the help of few volunteers other than myself, things can and do go wrong. Believe me, I am just as lost as you are when the site is down, and always do my best to get it back up and running as soon as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em style="color: grey;">In 2011, 4chan was accessed by 190 million unique visitors, and served 7 billion pageviews.</em></p>
 
 
<p><strong>2012</strong> got off to a good start. In May we re-wrote the image boards to be valid HTML5/CSS3&mdash;the first major change to the HTML in almost <em>nine years</em>. This was done to improve client-side performance and allow for the easy creation of user scripts and extensions, and enabled us to serve a pretty nifty <a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/news/4chanmobile3.png" target="_blank">mobile site</a> too. We also added support for secure browsing via SSL, SPDY, and have made a number of improvements on the backend to make the site run faster than ever.</p>
<p>On the heels of those improvements, last week 4chan crossed 1 billion total posts. Never in a million years would I have predicted reaching this milestone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em style="color: grey; text-align: center;">This year, 4chan has been accessed by 134 million unique visitors, and served 4.5 billion pageviews.<br/>Since 2008, it has been visited by more than 500 million people.</em></p>
 
<p>Which brings us to the <strong>present</strong>. Where do we go from here?</p>
<p>The most pressing issue facing the community is a lack of consistent moderation and communication from myself and the team. Sound familiar? That's because it was the same story <a href="?all#99" target="_blank">four years ago</a>. Before reading on, I highly encourage you read the linked news post.</p>
<p>If you've been paying attention to the statistics woven into this post, you'll have noticed the site has grown considerably over the years. That growth has strained us in every way imaginable, and it shows. Four years ago, I proposed doing a sort of "Prime Minister's Questions," where users would have the opportunity to submit questions to be answered by myself and the moderators. Unfortunately it never came to pass, but the idea always stuck with me. After all, any thread I post in as "moot" tends to immediately devolve into an impromptu Q&amp;A session.</p>
<p>Today I'm pleased to announce <span class="s">/q/ - 4chan Discussion</span>. Our earliest users will remember the "/q/ - Questions" image board from back in 2004, and the "/sug/ - Suggestions" discussion board from 2005-2006. Both served as a place where users could discuss the site amongst themselves and with the team, and in that spirit, I plan to host regularly scheduled Q&amp;A sessions (think PMQs) and use /q/ as a venue to interact with and collect feedback from the community.</p>
<p>In addition to launching /q/, we'll be re-opening <a href="/janitorapp" target="_blank">janitor applications</a> in the coming weeks. For those who don't know, janitors are users who can access the reports queue and delete posts from their assigned board(s). They cannot ban users and are not full moderators. We debuted the janitor program some years ago to give dedicated members of the community the ability to clean up the boards they care about and visit frequently.</p>
<p>I hope this news post is the first of many to come. While they can be daunting to write, you all deserve to be updated more than once every four years, and there are a few more things I look forward to announcing in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Before I end, I want to explain why I still do this.</p>
<p>I founded 4chan in 2003, when I was 15 years old. As of today, I've been running the site for almost 9 years, which represents more than one-third of my entire life. I have used 4chan daily since its inception and cannot imagine a life without it. As I said earlier&mdash;when 4chan goes down, I'm just as lost as the rest of you.</p>
<p>I think of 4chan as a hobby and not a business. To that end, I don't operate it in a way that any sane business person would. I am proud of the fact that I've been able to provide the site free of charge, with minimal advertising and without annoying donation campaigns for almost seven years now. As I've said in the past, we do a lot with very little, and despite being constantly resource constrained, the site has flourished. None of this would have ever been possible without the thousands of hours of time generously given by our dedicated volunteers, and support of our loyal community.</p>
<p>I have met countless people and made great friends through 4chan&mdash;Hell, I've even dated a few. For as bad a rap as 4channers can get from the outside world, my experience has been the exact opposite. While posting on the boards can sometimes be a crapshoot, every single person I've met on the street, at a meetup, conference, or for bubble tea has been <em>awesome</em>.</p>
<p>This community has accomplished remarkable things. You have all impacted the Internet, mainstream culture, and history in a profound way. It has truly been a privilege and great honor to be a partcipant and witness to it all.</p>
<p>I can honestly say I wouldn't trade these past eight and a half years for anything in the world. And for that, you all have my thanks.</p>
